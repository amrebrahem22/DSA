# Merge Sort

## WHY LEARN THIS?
1. The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
2. Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!
3. We need to be able to sort large arrays more quickly

## FASTER SORTS
1. There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n  ) to O(n log n)
2. There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
3. The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand

# Merge Sort
1. It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting!
2. Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
3. Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array

## How does it work?
```js
        [ 8, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2 ]

    [ 8, 3, 5, 4 ]          [ 7, 6, 1, 2 ]

[ 8, 3 ]     [ 5, 4 ]      [ 7, 6 ]    [ 1, 2 ]

[ 8 ] [ 3 ]  [ 5 ] [ 4 ]  [ 7 ] [ 6 ]  [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

  [ 3, 8 ]      [ 4, 5 ]     [ 6, 7 ]    [ 1, 2 ]

      [ 3, 4, 5, 8 ]             [ 1, 2, 6, 7 ]

           [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
```

## Merging Arrays
1. In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible for merging two sorted arrays
2. Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted, and consists of all of the elements in the two input arrays
3. This function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space and should not modify the parameters passed to it

## Merging Arrays Pseudocode
1. Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array
2. While there are still values we haven't looked at...
    - If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first array into our results and move on to the next value in the first array
    - If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second array into our results and move on to the next value in the second array
    - Once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array

```js
function merge(arr1, arr2) {
    let i = 0; // first index in arr1
    let j = 0; // first index in arr2
    let results = [];
    
    // while we didn't reach to the end of the array
    while(i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
        if (arr2[j] > arr1[i]) {
            // push if less than
            results.push(arr1[i])
            i++;
        } else {
            results.push(arr2[j])
            j++;
        }
    }
     // then we need to make sure the the rest of the arr1 added to the result because if the length with the two arrays is not the same, there will be values not added to the results
    while (i < arr1.length) {
        results.push(arr1[i])
        i++;
    }
    
    // do the same for the second array
    while (j < arr2.length) {
        results.push(arr2[j])
        j++;
    }
    return results;
}

merge([1, 10, 50], [2, 14, 99, 100]) // [1, 2, 10, 14, 50, 99, 100]
```


# mergeSort Pseudocode
1. Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
2. Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array
3. Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array

```js
function merge(arr1, arr2) {
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    let results = [];
    
    while(i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
        if (arr2[j] > arr1[i]) {
            results.push(arr1[i])
            i++;
        } else {
            results.push(arr2[j])
            j++;
        }
    }
    while (i < arr1.length) {
        results.push(arr1[i])
        i++;
    }
    
    while (j < arr2.length) {
        results.push(arr2[j])
        j++;
    }
    return results;
}

function mergeSort(arr) {
    // base case, for recursion
    if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

    // get the middle point
    let midd = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); // split it
    // first half, with recursion, to keep spliting
    let left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, midd));
    // the other half
    let right = mergeSort(arr.slice(midd));

    // merge the sorted left and right array together
    return merge(left, right);
}

mergeSort([10, 24, 76, 73]);
```

## Big O of mergeSort
1. Time Complexity (Best)	     `O(n log n)`
2. Time Complexity (Average)	 `O(n log n)`
3. Time Complexity (Worst)	     `O(n log n)`
4. Space Complexity             `O(n)`
